# ACTIVELabs Security Advisories
ACTIVELabs believes that coordinated, responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities is in the best interest of our clients and the public at large. ACTIVELabs regularly identifies security vulnerabilities in the course of our work, both during customer engagements and through our own independent security research. This stream contains the list of security advisories found by ACTIVELabs research team along with the proof-of-concept code if any.
