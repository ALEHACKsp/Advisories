## ACTIVE-2019-010: Netwrix Auditor - Symbolic Link Privilege Escalation

### Vulnerability Type:
Privilege Escalation

### Vendors:
Netwrix Corporation

### CVE ID:
None.

### Affected Products:
- Netwrix Auditor version 9.7 and earlier


### Summary:
Netwrix Auditor version 9.7 and earlier suffer from insecure file permissions on `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor\Logs\ActiveDirectory\` directory and it's sub-folders. In addition, the service `Netwrix.ADA.StorageAuditService` which writes to said directory does not preform proper impersonation, meaning the target file will have the same permissions as the invoking process, that is the log file (in this case, granting `Authenticated Users` full access over the target file). This vulnerability can be triggered by low privileged user to perform DLL Hijacking/Binary Planing attacks and ultimately execute code as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with the help of Symbolic Links.

### Mitigation:
The vendor has released a patch in version 9.8 addressing this vulnerability.

### Credit:
This vulnerability was found by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.

### References:
None
