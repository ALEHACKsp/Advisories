### Summary:
Multiple ManageEngine products suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions of `C:\ManageEngine` directory and its sub-folders which grant the `Users` group the `Create Files / write data` permission. Moreover, the services associated with said products will try to execute a number of nonexistent binaries such as `sc.exe` from the current directory upon system start. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` by placing a payload as one of the nonexistent binaries in the problematic folder.

### Mitigation:
The reported vulnerability has been fixed in version 100393, please refer to vendor website for more information.
