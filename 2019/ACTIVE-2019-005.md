### Summary:
Multiple SolarWinds products suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper settings of `erl.exe` service, meaning the process current directory is set to `C:\ProgramData\SolarWinds\Orion\RabbitMQ\`. Moreover, the service execute the command `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c handle.exe /accepteula -s -p 1180 2> nul` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` every five seconds, naturally the process will first try to run the non-existing `handle.exe` binary from the current directory which happens to be writable by standard users. 

### Mitigation:
Apply Orion Platform 2018.4 Hotfix 2 or higher.
