## ACTIVE-2019-008: Pandora FMS Local Privilege Escalation

### Vulnerability Type:
Privilege Escalation

### Vendors:
Pandora FMS

### CVE ID:
None.

### Affected Products:
Pandora FMS 7.0 NG 734 and older

### Summary:
Pandora FMS 7.0 NG 734 and older suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions of `C:\PandoraFMS` directory and its sub-folders allowing standard users to create new files. Moreover, the Apache service `httpd.exe` will try to execute `cmd.exe` from the current directory, that is `C:\PandoraFMS` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` upon web requests to the portal. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on effected systems by dropping payload as `cmd.exe` in any of the problematic folders and then making web request to Pandora portal using the command `wget http://localhost/pandora_console/index.php | Out-Null`.

### Mitigation:
Patch was released in Pandora FMS 7.0 NG 735.

### Credit:
This vulnerability was found by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.
